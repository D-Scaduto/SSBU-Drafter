implement new layouts (see mock images in this dir)
make components visibility toggleable, and have remaining components re-adjust size to fill the rest of the screen, within reasonable limits
add preset visibility templates (Draft, Battle, All)

bugs:
    make sure pool picks stay within their bounds
    strange sizeing on the BAN section when many characters were picked
